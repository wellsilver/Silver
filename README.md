# Silver-Project
A project where I attempt to create a Chat App using batch.


first off tbis readme is gonna do a really bad jvob
but heres the run down.

Plans: 

Remember last server
dedicated admin window (Easier on me because the "for" command confuses me beyond your comprehension)
auto set up server (first stuff will prob be bad)
any kind of encoding (Security)
